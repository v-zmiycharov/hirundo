Twitter clone written in Node using Sails.js. This is a university course project so it probably won't be of much interest to you. Anyways..

## Requirements
* NodeJs v0.10
* Mongo

## Development setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Execute `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Start the mongo server with `mongod`
4. Run the app using `sails lift`

# Running the tests
You can run the tests with `npm test`. This will execute the unit tests located under `/test` as well as the feature tests located under `/features`.
